# Supermarket-Market-AI
## Description
In the following repository you will find a project focusing on usage of Artificial Intelligence in everyday life, in this case supermarket.
The project is divided into three parts:
1. Multi-Layer Perceptron Model which categorises products based on their features. Model gained 80% accurancy on the test set.
2. Ant Colony Optimalization which finds a short path between two points in a supermarket(maze). Below you can find an example solution of medium level maze.

3. Reinforcement Learning which finds the best path between two points in a supermarket(maze) based on rewards.

Each part contains a report of observations and conclusions, collected by my project group. Projetc conducted as part of Computational Intelligence course at TU Delft.
